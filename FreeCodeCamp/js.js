// Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String
// You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

// For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the const firstName = "Augusta" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]

// Example:

// const firstName = "Augusta";
// const thirdToLastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 3];
// thirdToLastLetter would have a value of the string s.

// Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string.

// Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.
// Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length-2]; // Change this line


// Word Blanks
// We will now use our knowledge of strings to build a "Mad Libs" style word game we're calling "Word Blanks". You will create an (optionally humorous) "Fill in the Blanks" style sentence.

// In a "Mad Libs" game, you are provided sentences with some missing words, like nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. You then fill in the missing pieces with words of your choice in a way that the completed sentence makes sense.

// Consider this sentence - It was really ____, and we ____ ourselves ____. This sentence has three missing pieces- an adjective, a verb and an adverb, and we can add words of our choice to complete it. We can then assign the completed sentence to a variable as follows:

// const sentence = "It was really " + "hot" + ", and we " + "laughed" + " ourselves " + "silly" + ".";
// In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.

// You will need to use the string concatenation operator + to build a new string, using the provided variables: myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, and myAdverb. You will then assign the formed string to the wordBlanks variable. You should not change the words assigned to the variables.

// You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence.



const myNoun = "dog";
const myAdjective = "big";
const myVerb = "ran";
const myAdverb = "quickly";

// Only change code below this line
const wordBlanks =myAdjective+" "+myNoun+" "+myVerb+" "+myAdverb ; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line

// Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
// With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

// You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

// const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
// Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).

// Only change code below this line
const myArray = ["string",4];



// Nest one Array within Another Array
// You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

// const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
// This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

// Create a nested array called myArray.
// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [[],[]];

// Access Array Data with Indexes
// We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

// Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.


// Example

// const array = [50, 60, 70];
// console.log(array[0]);
// const data = array[1];
// The console.log(array[0]) prints 50, and data has the value 60.

// Create a variable called myData and set it to equal the first value of myArray using bracket notation.

const myArray = [50, 60, 70];

const myData = myArray[0];


// Modify Array Data With Indexes
// Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with const.

// Example

// const ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
// ourArray[0] = 15;
// ourArray now has the value [15, 40, 30].

// Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

// Modify the data stored at index 0 of myArray to a value of 45.

// Setup
const myArray = [18, 64, 99];
myArray[0]=45;
// Only change code below this line

// Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
// One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

// Example

// const arr = [
//   [1, 2, 3],
//   [4, 5, 6],
//   [7, 8, 9],
//   [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14]
// ];

// arr[3];
// arr[3][0];
// arr[3][0][1];
// arr[3] is [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14], arr[3][0] is [10, 11, 12], and arr[3][0][1] is 11.

// Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0][0] and even this array [0] [0] is not allowed. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

// Using bracket notation select an element from myArray such that myData is equal to 8.

const myArray = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9],
    [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14],
  ];
  
  const myData = myArray[2][1];
