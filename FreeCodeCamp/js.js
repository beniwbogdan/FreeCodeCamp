// Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String
// You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

// For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the const firstName = "Augusta" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]

// Example:

// const firstName = "Augusta";
// const thirdToLastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 3];
// thirdToLastLetter would have a value of the string s.

// Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string.

// Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.
// Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length-2]; // Change this line


// Word Blanks
// We will now use our knowledge of strings to build a "Mad Libs" style word game we're calling "Word Blanks". You will create an (optionally humorous) "Fill in the Blanks" style sentence.

// In a "Mad Libs" game, you are provided sentences with some missing words, like nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. You then fill in the missing pieces with words of your choice in a way that the completed sentence makes sense.

// Consider this sentence - It was really ____, and we ____ ourselves ____. This sentence has three missing pieces- an adjective, a verb and an adverb, and we can add words of our choice to complete it. We can then assign the completed sentence to a variable as follows:

// const sentence = "It was really " + "hot" + ", and we " + "laughed" + " ourselves " + "silly" + ".";
// In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.

// You will need to use the string concatenation operator + to build a new string, using the provided variables: myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, and myAdverb. You will then assign the formed string to the wordBlanks variable. You should not change the words assigned to the variables.

// You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence.



const myNoun = "dog";
const myAdjective = "big";
const myVerb = "ran";
const myAdverb = "quickly";

// Only change code below this line
const wordBlanks =myAdjective+" "+myNoun+" "+myVerb+" "+myAdverb ; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line

// Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
// With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

// You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

// const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
// Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).

// Only change code below this line
const myArray = ["string",4];



// Nest one Array within Another Array
// You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

// const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
// This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

// Create a nested array called myArray.
// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [[],[]];

// Access Array Data with Indexes
// We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

// Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.


// Example

// const array = [50, 60, 70];
// console.log(array[0]);
// const data = array[1];
// The console.log(array[0]) prints 50, and data has the value 60.

// Create a variable called myData and set it to equal the first value of myArray using bracket notation.

const myArray = [50, 60, 70];

const myData = myArray[0];


// Modify Array Data With Indexes
// Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with const.

// Example

// const ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
// ourArray[0] = 15;
// ourArray now has the value [15, 40, 30].

// Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

// Modify the data stored at index 0 of myArray to a value of 45.

// Setup
const myArray = [18, 64, 99];
myArray[0]=45;
// Only change code below this line

// Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
// One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

// Example

// const arr = [
//   [1, 2, 3],
//   [4, 5, 6],
//   [7, 8, 9],
//   [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14]
// ];

// arr[3];
// arr[3][0];
// arr[3][0][1];
// arr[3] is [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14], arr[3][0] is [10, 11, 12], and arr[3][0][1] is 11.

// Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0][0] and even this array [0] [0] is not allowed. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

// Using bracket notation select an element from myArray such that myData is equal to 8.

const myArray = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9],
    [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14],
  ];
  
  const myData = myArray[2][1];

//   Manipulate Arrays With push()
// An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.

// .push() takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.

// Examples:

// const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
// arr1.push(4);

// const arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
// arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]);
// arr1 now has the value [1, 2, 3, 4] and arr2 has the value ["Stimpson", "J", "cat", ["happy", "joy"]].

// Push ["dog", 3] onto the end of the myArray variable.

// Setup
const myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];
myArray.push(["dog", 3]);

// Manipulate Arrays With pop()
// Another way to change the data in an array is with the .pop() function.

// .pop() is used to pop a value off of the end of an array. We can store this popped off value by assigning it to a variable. In other words, .pop() removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

// Any type of entry can be popped off of an array - numbers, strings, even nested arrays.

// const threeArr = [1, 4, 6];
// const oneDown = threeArr.pop();
// console.log(oneDown);
// console.log(threeArr);
// The first console.log will display the value 6, and the second will display the value [1, 4].

// Use the .pop() function to remove the last item from myArray and assign the popped off value to a new variable, removedFromMyArray.

// Setup
const myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];
const removedFromMyArray=myArray.pop(["cat", 2]);

// Manipulate Arrays With shift()
// pop() always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?

// That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.

// Example:

// const ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", ["cat"]];
// const removedFromOurArray = ourArray.shift();
// removedFromOurArray would have a value of the string Stimpson, and ourArray would have ["J", ["cat"]].

// Use the .shift() function to remove the first item from myArray and assign the "shifted off" value to a new variable, removedFromMyArray.

// Setup
const myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];
const removedFromMyArray  = myArray.shift();
// Only change code below this line

// Manipulate Arrays With unshift()
// Not only can you shift elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also unshift elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.

// .unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.

// Example:

// const ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
// ourArray.shift();
// ourArray.unshift("Happy");
// After the shift, ourArray would have the value ["J", "cat"]. After the unshift, ourArray would have the value ["Happy", "J", "cat"].

// Add ["Paul", 35] to the beginning of the myArray variable using unshift().

// Setup
const myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];
myArray.shift();
myArray.unshift(["Paul", 35]);

// Only change code below this line


// Shopping List
// Create a shopping list in the variable myList. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

// The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.

// ["Chocolate Bar", 15]
// There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.

const myList = [["Chocolate Bar", 15],
["Chocolate Bar", 15],
["Chocolate Bar", 15],
["Chocolate Bar", 15],
["Chocolate Bar", 15]];

Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions
In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

// Here's an example of a function:

// function functionName() {
//   console.log("Hello World");
// }
// You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: functionName(); Each time the function is called it will print out the message Hello World on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

// Create a function called reusableFunction which prints the string Hi World to the dev console.
// Call the function.

let reusableFunction =()=>{
    console.log("Hi World");
  }
  reusableFunction();

//   Passing Values to Functions with Arguments
// Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.

// Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:

// function testFun(param1, param2) {
//   console.log(param1, param2);
// }
// Then we can call testFun like this: testFun("Hello", "World");. We have passed two string arguments, Hello and World. Inside the function, param1 will equal the string Hello and param2 will equal the string World. Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.

// Create a function called functionWithArgs that accepts two arguments and outputs their sum to the dev console.
// Call the function with two numbers as arguments.

let functionWithArgs =(arg1,arg2)=>{
    console.log(arg1+arg2) ;
  }
  
  functionWithArgs(1,2);

//   Return a Value from a Function with Return
// We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.

// Example

// function plusThree(num) {
//   return num + 3;
// }

// const answer = plusThree(5);
// answer has the value 8.

// plusThree takes an argument for num and returns a value equal to num + 3.

// Create a function timesFive that accepts one argument, multiplies it by 5, and returns the new value.
let timesFive =(n)=>{
    return n*5;
  }
  timesFive(1);

//   Global Scope and Functions
// In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

// Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with let or const.

// Using let or const, declare a global variable named myGlobal outside of any function. Initialize it with a value of 10.

// Inside function fun1, assign 5 to oopsGlobal without using the let or const keywords.

// Declare the myGlobal variable below this line
let myGlobal =10;
var oopsGlobal;
function fun1() {
  // Assign 5 to oopsGlobal Here
oopsGlobal=5;
}

// Only change code above this line

function fun2() {
  var output = "";
  if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += "myGlobal: " + myGlobal;
  }
  if (typeof oopsGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += " oopsGlobal: " + oopsGlobal;
  }
  console.log(output);
}

// Local Scope and Functions
// Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.

// Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

// function myTest() {
//   const loc = "foo";
//   console.log(loc);
// }

// myTest();
// console.log(loc);
// The myTest() function call will display the string foo in the console. The console.log(loc) line (outside of the myTest function) will throw an error, as loc is not defined outside of the function.

// The editor has two console.logs to help you see what is happening. Check the console as you code to see how it changes. Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope and run the tests.

// Note: The console will still display ReferenceError: myVar is not defined, but this will not cause the tests to fail.
function myLocalScope() {
    // Only change code below this line
  let myVar=4 ;
    console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
  }
  myLocalScope();
  
  // Run and check the console
  // myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
  console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);

//   Global vs. Local Scope in Functions
// It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.

// In this example:

// const someVar = "Hat";

// function myFun() {
//   const someVar = "Head";
//   return someVar;
// }
// The function myFun will return the string Head because the local version of the variable is present.

// Add a local variable to myOutfit function to override the value of outerWear with the string sweater.
